    "### AIC and DIC\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to model selection is to use an information-theoretic criterion to identify the most appropriate model. Akaike (1973) found a formal relationship between Kullback-Leibler information (a dominant paradigm in information and coding theory) and likelihood theory. Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) is an estimator of expected relative K-L information based on the maximized log-likelihood function, corrected for asymptotic bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{AIC} = −2 \\log(L(\\theta|data)) + 2K$$\n",
    "\n",
    "AIC balances the fit of the model (in terms of the likelihood) with the number of parameters required to achieve that fit. We can easily calculate AIC from the residual sums of squares as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{AIC} = n \\log(\\text{RSS}/n) + 2k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k$ is the number of parameters in the model. Notice that as the number of parameters increase, the residual sum of squares goes down, but the second term (a penalty) increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A limitation of AIC for Bayesian models is that it cannot be applied to hierarchical models (or any models with random effects), as counting the number of parameters in such models is problematic. A more Bayesian version of AIC is called the deviance information criterion (DIC), and replaces the fixed parameter penalty with an estimate of the effective number of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_{DIC} = 2\\left(\\log p(y | E[\\theta | y]) - E_{post}[\\log p(y|\\theta)] \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the second term is an average of $\\theta$ over the posterior distribution:\n",

As a result, it can be unstable for hierarchical models, sometimes producing estimates of effective number of parameters that is negative."

In general, models with more parameters will be more flexible to fit data and at the same time could also lead to overfitting. Thus we can interpret pWAIC as a penalization term, intuitively we can also interpret it as measure of how flexible each model is in fitting the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Sometimes when comparing models, we do not want to select the \"best\" model, instead we want to perform predictions by averaging along all the models (or at least several models). Ideally we would like to perform a weighted average, giving more weight to the model that seems to explain/predict the data better. There are many approaches to perform this task, one of them is to use Akaike weights based on the values of WAIC for each model. These weights can be loosely interpreted as the probability of each model (among the compared models) given the data. One caveat of this approach is that the weights are based on point estimates of WAIC (i.e. the uncertainty is ignored).\n",

Nevertheless, caution need to be taken because the estimation of the standard error assumes normality and hence could be problematic when the sample size is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. In the same way that we can compute the standard error for each value of WAIC, we can compute the standard error of the differences between two values of WAIC. Notice that both quantities are not necessarily the same, the reason is that the uncertainty about WAIC is correlated between models. This quantity is always 0 for the top-ranked model.\n",

A value of `True` indicates that the computation of WAIC may not be reliable, this warning is based on an empirical determined cutoff value and need to be interpreted with caution. For more details you can read this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04544).\n",
